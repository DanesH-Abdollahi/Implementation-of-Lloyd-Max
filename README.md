# Implementation-of-Lloyd-Max
Implementation of Lloyd-Max Algorithm in Nonuniform Quantizer for a Gaussian Source in Matlab from Scratch.

--- 
### `Part 1`

For a zero-mean and unit variance Gaussian Random Variable X the boudaries of the quantizer are given by {−5, −4, −2, 0, 1, 3, 5}.

- Find out representatore, i.e. centroids, of each region and compute variance of the quantization
noise and SQNR.

### `Part 2`

For a Gaussian Zero-mean Random Variable X with vainace $σ^2 = P$

- Run the Lloyd-Max algorithm and find out the optimal boundries and cetroids and then plot
SQNR in [dB] verus number of quantization levels N, for $N = 4, 8, 16, 32$ and $P = 1$.

- Repeat previous section for $P = 5,10$
